# ART++ :phone: :movie_camera: :art:
Augmented Reality application to show art in real-time in real-size.

> You can find more details about the pedestrian comfort theme in our FAQs, but in a nutshell, we’re looking for participants to create something that falls into one of the three categories of pedestrian comfort: play, safety and health.

- **Play: Create something that helps people use our streets in a new ways and encourages community.**
- Safety: Create something that helps increase pedestrian safety on Calgary’s streets.
- Health: Create something that helps encourage Calgarians to get outside and be active.

We had to use at least one dataset from the City of Calgary.

## My contribution

I programmed the AR portion of the app and gave the presentation.

## Inspiration

The following are some of the problems the city is facing when choosing a new public art piece:

- Citizens do not have a voice
- Citizens engagement is limited
- Finished art usually does not fit in
- Time and money are not well spent

So we decided to create a solution that will make sure our city steps it's game up with public art.

## What it does

The following are some of the benefits our solution introduces:

- Encourages citizens to explore their city
- Everyone can be heard and participate in choosing an art piece in their community
- Shows the project before it is built, which allows the city to plan ahead without huge costs

## How we built it

- Used C# programming language
- Used Unity along side with ARCore
- Used [Community Boundaries dataset](https://data.calgary.ca/Base-Maps/Community-Boundaries/ab7m-fwn6)
- Used [Point Inclusion algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-check-if-a-given-point-lies-inside-a-polygon/)

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

This was mostly a learning experience for most members of the group to expose them to Augmented Reality technologies, as well as data processing and data visualization. ART++ is fully functional, and we hope to squish bugs, add features, and improve its performance in the future.

## What we learned

- Augmented Reality technologies
- Computational geometry algorithms
- Data processing
- Data visualization

## What's next for ART++
- Add new features
  - Donations
  - Extend to not just art, also include buildings, parks, bridges, etc...
- Create a portal to upload art models
